# game-dev---minesweeper
i tried exploiting the different data structures in Java (i.e. stacks and queues; implementations and extends)

Controls:
- to place a flag:  [x] [y] [-1]
- to dig:           [x] [y] [1]

goals
- don't step on the MINES!!
- the number shown on the CELL you have stepped indicates the number of MINES surrounding the step
- correrctly identify all the mines by placing a FLAG on it
